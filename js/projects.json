    "projectCaption": "This is my pride and joy. Pixel Planet Today is a passion-fueled 'Design 365' turned-daily project I decided to undertake in July 2019. The daily pixel designs highlight facts about the planet in order to help raise an appreciation for the planet. I have continued to post every day for over a year with no end in sight. On top of the daily posts, I have also wrote blog posts about my journey, created and sold stickers to raise money for environmental causes, and made animated versions of my posts to celebrate follower milestones.",
